# Telecom Churn Prediction (Case Study)

## 📌 Overview  
This project focuses on predicting **customer churn** in the telecom sector, with a special focus on **high-value customers**. Churn prediction helps retention teams identify customers likely to leave and take proactive measures.  

The case study applies **EDA, data preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning models** to deliver actionable insights for churn reduction.

## 🎯 Project Steps  
1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Cleaned missing values and encoded categorical features  
   - Standardized numerical features  
   - Prepared target variable (Churn: Yes/No)  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Analyzed churn distribution  
   - Visualized patterns in customer demographics, contracts, and usage  
   - Identified key churn drivers such as contract type and monthly charges  

3. **Model Building**  
   - Applied **Logistic Regression**  
   - Applied **Random Forest Classifier** with hyperparameter tuning  

4. **Model Evaluation**  
   - Logistic Regression Accuracy: **78%**  
   - Tuned Random Forest Accuracy: **92%**  
   - Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC
